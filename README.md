<p text-align="center">I am a Full-Stack Software Developer with experience in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React, GraphQL and both relational and non-relational databases. I love data, component structure and clean testing. I lead with curiosity, passion, drive and a healthy amount of play. My background in the arts has primed my tech career with empathy  and a love for dynamic collaboration. As a queer woman of color, I value diversity of thought, technology and humans; and I love the daily challenge of navigating how that diversity coexists. I am brave in my contributions, have a thirst for learning new tech and embrace failure. I value spending my time away from the computer mentoring those pursuing tech, teaching students the wonders of code and speaking at meet ups.</p>
